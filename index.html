                <h2>The Hidden Cost of Donating</h2>
                <p>Donating plasma is a powerful way to do good, but it takes a significant toll on your body. Each donation removes 50-60 grams of protein and vital electrolytes, leading to dizziness, fatigue, and dehydration that can ruin the rest of your day. Water helps, but it doesn't solve the core problem.</p>
